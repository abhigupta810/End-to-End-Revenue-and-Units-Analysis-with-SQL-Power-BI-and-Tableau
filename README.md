# End-to-End-Revenue-and-Units-Analysis-with-SQL-Power-BI-and-Tableau
Project Summary:

This project focused on integrating multiple tables using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create a single consolidated table, streamlining data visualization and analysis. Following this, a Power BI dashboard was developed to present insights effectively.

The first phase involved identifying and selecting the relevant tables that contained the necessary data. These tables, originating from different sources or representing various aspects of the dataset, were combined using SSMS through key-based joins and relationships. This consolidation ensured that all essential data was centralized in a single repository, reducing the need for repeated complex queries and simplifying the analytical process.

With the consolidated table in place, the next step was to enhance data accessibility through a Power BI dashboard. Power BI's interactive and dynamic visualization capabilities were leveraged to present key metrics, trends, and insights in an intuitive format. The dashboard featured various visual elements, including charts, graphs, and tables, allowing users to analyze patterns and filter data based on specific criteria.

The interactive nature of the dashboard enabled users to explore the dataset efficiently, drill down into detailed insights, and make data-driven decisions with ease. By combining SSMS for data consolidation and Power BI for visualization, the project successfully created a seamless analytical experience, improving efficiency and supporting better decision-making strategies.
